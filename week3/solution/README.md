The workings of this solution are as follows.
- Read the image and encode into a numpy array
- count the amount of pure red, green, blue pixels there are respectively (2265, 2158, 2222)
- append the binary encoding of r ++ g ++ b (100011011001100001101110100010101110)
- Convert back into decimal (38009235630)
